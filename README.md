# **Sprocket Central Pty Ltd Data Analysis**

In this Virtual Internship, I worked as a data Analyst for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a dynamic medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories fictional organization under KPMG Data Analytics virtual Internship. 



## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to leverage the power of data to identify the high-value customers within a dataset of 1000 prospects. By analyzing customer demographic, customer address, and transactions datasets, I tried to uncover hidden insights that will drive maximum value for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.


## Tools and References

For this project, the following tools and references were utilized:

* **Power BI**: Used to create the interactive dashboard for presenting data summaries and analysis results.
* **PowerPoint**: Employed to create the presentation outlining the approach and strategies for the data insights phase.
* **MS Excel**: Used for data analysis, cleaning, and manipulation tasks.

## Task Overview

The project is divided into three stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis.

**Stage 1: Data Quality Assessment**

In this stage, the focus is on assessing the quality and completeness of the provided data in preparation for analysis. The task involves drafting an email to the client to identify the data quality issues and propose strategies to mitigate these issues. You can find my submission for this task [here](https://github.com/jayantjy9/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Mail%20for%20Customer.docx).

**Stage 2: Data Insights**

The second stage revolves around targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. The task is to prepare a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the approach to be taken, including a detailed strategy for each of the three phases. This includes activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, results interpretation, and reporting. You can find my submission for this task [here](https://github.com/jayantjy9/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data%20Insights%20Documentation.pptx).

**Stage 3: Data Insights and Presentation**

The final stage focuses on using visualizations to present insights derived from the data analysis. The task is to develop a dashboard that can be presented to the client. The dashboard should include data summaries and analysis results, presented in a visually appealing manner. The dashboard should address the business context by showcasing trends in the underlying data, identifying the customer segment with the highest customer value, proposing marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

## Key Takeaways

Here are the key findings from the analysis:

@ **Age group**: The sweet spot for our target audience lies between 41 and 50. This age range shows promising potential for driving value and should be a prime focus in our marketing efforts.

@ **Gender-based profit analysis**: Female customers have proven to generate slightly higher profits compared to male customers. Capitalizing on this insight, we can develop targeted strategies to engage and satisfy our female customer base. Furthermore, the months of October and August stand out as particularly lucrative and deserve special attention in our marketing calendar.

**State-wise distribution**: The state of NSW emerges as the hub of cycling transactions, accounting for a whopping 53% of the total. By strategically targeting this region, we can tap into the thriving cycling community and maximize our impact.

**Transactions based on job category**: The manufacturing and financial services sectors present exceptional opportunities, as they account for almost 40% of total transactions. Tailoring our marketing efforts to these job categories will allow us to forge strong connections and drive value.

**Transactions based on wealth segment**: Mass customers dominate the wealth segment, contributing to a significant 50% of total transactions. This segment holds tremendous potential for expanding our customer base and fueling growth.
